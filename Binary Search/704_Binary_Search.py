# Note: in Binary search mid will give the ans always. so for making any decision or condition in 'if' or 'while' loop, just think from 'mid' 
# i.e if it is not equal to mid then where to move for this 'if' condition.

# Note: for initialising 'low' and 'up' just find the range in which we can get the ans.
# and initialise 'low'= min range value and 'up'= maximum range value.
# after this use template 1 or template 2 according to the Q.

# 'up' hmesha '>= target' me update hoga and low '<=' target me update hoga, 
# kyonki hmlog ko size hmesha decrease karna h.

# Template 1:
# Note: use this template in case if elements are not present then  we have to return some valid number, and
# if present  then simply we will get the ans inside the while loop.
# e.g: Q like: 1) find ceil and floor of a number in sorted array  2) find square root of a number  
# 3) Find 1st bad version 4) 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target 5) 35. Search Insert Position

# here while loop will only break when low>up then 'low' will give the ceil value(just greater than key) and 
# 'high' will give the floor value(just less than key) since 
# after while loop low will become '1' greater than 'high'.

# in case of duplicate ele it will give any index where it will find the ans first.

# Template 2:  most important template
# Note vvi: we use when we have to find the smallest amomg all possible ans.

# here after while loop will break then 'low' and 'high' will become equal.
# so any one of them will point to 'key' if key is present. After while loop both will point to the same thing.

# use this template when we are asked to return ans if present else simply return '-1'
# (or something fixed value given to return in case if not present) or given ans exist for sure.
# here we make decision after while loop only i.e what to return as final ans.
# e.g: search for an element in an array.

# Note: in case of duplicate elements, it will give the 1st index where ele is present.
# because even after finding the ans(>=), we are continuing our checking and shrinking the mid(decreasing the up).

# agar ans mil bhi gya ho(>=) to or range shrink karke(up ko decr karke) even or chota dhundho.

# here after while loop will break then 'low' and 'high' will become equal.
# so any one of them will point to 'key' if key is present.
